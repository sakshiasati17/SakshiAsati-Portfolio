# Sakshi Asati – Portfolio

This repository backs the personal portfolio I use to highlight my work as a data scientist and ML engineer. It mirrors the site hosted on GitHub Pages and includes the HTML, CSS, JS, headshot, and current résumé that power the live experience.

## What’s inside

- `index.html` – the single-page layout for my portfolio
- `styles.css` – all of the custom styling and animations
- `script.js` – light-weight interactions (nav highlighting, counters, etc.)
- `profile_picture.jpg` – image displayed in the hero section
- `resume.pdf` – the downloadable résumé linked from the site

I keep the copy up to date so recruiters or collaborators always see the latest roles, projects, and honors.

## Local preview

```bash
cd "/Users/sakshiasati/Documents/sakshi asati new protfiolio"
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` to test changes before pushing them live.

## Deployment

The `main` branch is connected to GitHub Pages. Every push automatically rebuilds the public site. For a custom domain I point DNS to the Pages host and add the domain under **Settings → Pages**.
